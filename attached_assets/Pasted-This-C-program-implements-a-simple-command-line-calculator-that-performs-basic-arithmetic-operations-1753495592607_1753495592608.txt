This C program implements a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. ### How it Works: 1. **Include Header**: The program starts by including the `<stdio.h>` header file, which is essential for standard input and output functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`. 2. **Variable Declaration**: Inside the `main` function, three variables are declared: * `char op`: To store the arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) entered by the user. * `double first`, `double second`: To store the two numeric operands. The `double` data type is used to allow for floating-point values (numbers with decimal points). 3. **User Input**: The program prompts the user for input twice: * First, it asks for the operator using `printf()`. The `scanf(" %c", &op);` function reads a single character. The leading space in the format string `" %c"` is crucial; it tells `scanf` to skip any leading whitespace characters (like spaces, tabs, or newlines) left in the input buffer from previous entries. * Second, it asks for two numbers. `scanf("%lf %lf", &first, &second);` reads two `double` values from the user's input. 4. **Core Logic (Switch Statement)**: A `switch` statement is used to control the program flow based on the operator (`op`) the user entered. This is cleaner and often more efficient than a long series of `if-else if` statements. * `case '+':`, `case '-':`, `case '*':`: If the operator matches one of these, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed, and the result is printed to the console. The `%.1lf` format specifier in `printf` displays the `double` value rounded to one decimal place. * `case '/':`: This case includes a special check. Division by zero is undefined and would cause a program to crash. The `if (second != 0.0)` statement prevents this by first checking if the divisor is non-zero. If it is, the division is performed. Otherwise, a specific error message is shown. * `default:`: If the character entered by the user is not one of the valid operators, the `default` case is executed, informing the user that their input was invalid. * `break;`: The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` block after a case is executed, preventing the program from "falling through" to the next case. 5. **Return Statement**: `return 0;` signals to the operating system that the program executed successfully.
